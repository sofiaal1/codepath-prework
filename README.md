## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## My favorite apps
    1. FocusTraveller
        - Statistics/data on how long I focused for on the app each day/week/month/year
        - Ability to have a focus session with multiple online friends if you want
        - Visualization of how long you focus as a journey on a mountain (aesthetics)
    2. Locket
        - Widget feature where I can see the pictures my friends send me easily
        - Messages feature where I can reply to friends' pictures and text them in general
    3. NYT Games
        - Ability to play games from the archive
        - Minimalist design makes it easy to find the game you want to play
        
## My app idea
I have an idea for an app where the user connects with friends through fun activities to maintain and deepen their relationships. A potential activity could be a little diary with a prompt (e.g. 'What is your favorite memory with friendUsername?'), so that the user and their friend can both answer and see what they said. Another fun activity could be a little plant that the user and their friend(s) take care of, which helps them feel connected as they have something that they need to care for. Lastly, another feature could be for users to add a "snapshot of the day" where they send a photo at some point in the day of what they are doing.

## Notes

A major challenge I encountered was in Step 3, when I was connecting the UI to logic. At first, I connected a different IB instead of IBAction, so at first, my IB didn't have a body. I didn't realize this, and so when I followed the rest of the instructions, there were two errors which I didn't understand. I redid Step 3, and correctly made an IBAction, but this time I made the ChangeColor function within the body of the IBAction, which wasn't right. Once I realized this, I put it outside the IBAction, and the rest of the code worked great.
